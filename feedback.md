# Arielle, Slava and Vitali
1. Your hackathon project is great! The code is well-structured, clean, and readable. The idea is well-thought-out, and the execution and results are good.
2. I liked that you weren't afraid to use modules and Python functionalities that we didn't learn in class. That shows initiative and is a great quality for a developer!
3. From your code and comments, I can tell that you clearly understand what you've done and how you've done it.
4. As mentioned, your code is great, and I don't have major points to raise except for the structure. It's great that you created a file for each step of the project, but when you have that many files, it's better to create folders to group related files together."
5. Kol Akavod you did a wonderfull job!
